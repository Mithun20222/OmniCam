# OmniCam - Face Recognition System

OmniCam is a **real-time face recognition system** built with [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) and OpenCV.  
It recognizes authorized users, detects intruders, and keeps track of their status using a flag system.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸš€ Fast recognition with **SFace** model (optimized for CPU).
- âœ… Tracks authorized users with `flag=1`.
- ðŸš¨ Detects intruders with `flag=-1` (stable, requires multiple frames before confirmation).
- ðŸŽ¥ Real-time detection from webcam.
- ðŸŸ¢ Stable labels with smoothing (no flickering).
- ðŸ”’ Authorized face embeddings loaded from `data/authorized/`.
